MemPal × Distilled Knowledge Benchmark
=======================================

Tests retrieval of distilled operational knowledge — engineering constraints,
architectural decisions, and system invariants written as prose documents.

This benchmark complements the existing conversational benchmarks (LongMemEval,
LoCoMo, MemBench). Those benchmarks test episodic memory: "what did the user say
in session 3?" This benchmark tests semantic memory: "what is the correct
behaviour for X?" — the kind of knowledge engineers distill into runbooks,
architecture decision records, and internal wikis.

The corpus (30 entries) covers cross-cutting engineering constraints:
  - Concurrency and locking patterns
  - Database-specific gotchas (UUID handling, partitioned index limits)
  - Security gate pipelines (package validation, audit requirements)
  - Process isolation (sandboxing, privilege escalation)
  - Lifecycle state management
  - Error handling edge cases

The QA pairs (30 items) are paraphrased queries — the question wording
deliberately avoids the exact vocabulary in the document, testing whether
retrieval works on semantic similarity rather than keyword matching.

Metric: Recall@1 and Recall@5 (substring match of ground_truth_fragment in
the concatenated text of the top-k retrieved documents).

Usage:
    python benchmarks/distilled_knowledge_bench.py
    python benchmarks/distilled_knowledge_bench.py --top-k 5
    python benchmarks/distilled_knowledge_bench.py --verbose

ENTRIES: list[tuple[str, str]] = [
    ("mutex_cross_process.txt",
     "A cross-process file lock prevents two inference models from loading "
     "simultaneously on the same GPU. Without it, VRAM overflows silently and "
     "inference returns garbage instead of raising an error. The lock file lives "
     "in /tmp and is acquired with fcntl.flock before any model load."),

    ("uuid_driver_gotcha.txt",
     "The asyncpg database driver returns UUID objects natively from Postgres — "
     "never pass them through the uuid.UUID() constructor a second time because "
     "the constructor raises on an already-UUID input. This error surfaces during "
     "row-level migrations that rename or cast identifier columns."),

    ("audit_field_requirement.txt",
     "Every write to the action store must carry an injection_scan_score in its "
     "metadata. Hardcoded scores of 1.0 were found in three files during an audit; "
     "the guard module now enforces the field is present and dynamically computed "
     "rather than a compile-time constant."),

    ("partitioned_table_index.txt",
     "A partitioned database table has a constraint on concurrent index creation: "
     "CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY cannot run on the partitioned parent. The index must "
     "be built on each individual partition first; the parent index is then "
     "automatically composed from the partition indexes. Attempting it on the parent "
     "returns an error about 'cannot create index on partitioned table'."),

    ("two_tier_storage.txt",
     "The two-tier storage rule separates raw event telemetry from semantic agent "
     "memories. Raw telemetry goes to the relational database. Semantic memories go "
     "to the vector store. A pre-ingest deduplication check is mandatory before any "
     "vector store write — skip ingestion if the top-1 cosine similarity to an "
     "existing entry exceeds 0.95."),

    ("dual_confirmation_gate.txt",
     "High-risk actions require dual confirmation: operator approval plus a mandatory "
     "60-second enforced delay between approval and execution. The quorum check runs "
     "through an approval bridge service. Skipping either step is a compliance "
     "violation and must be flagged in the audit log."),

    ("kernel_probe_path_truncation.txt",
     "An eBPF LSM probe for path resolution fails on bind-mount paths because the "
     "kernel helper silently truncates beyond 256 bytes. The fix uses a two-pass "
     "approach: the kernel side records the inode, then userspace resolves the full "
     "path from the inode. This avoids the truncation limit entirely."),

    ("project_venv_shebang.txt",
     "All scripts that import project dependencies must use an explicit shebang "
     "pointing to the project virtual environment's Python interpreter. The system "
     "python3 does not have the project packages installed and will raise ImportError "
     "silently or fall back to an incompatible version."),

    ("nfs_soft_mount.txt",
     "Network-attached storage mounts using soft NFS must never be hard-depended on "
     "in real-time code paths. A stale NFS handle stalls the entire asyncio event "
     "loop indefinitely. Any NFS access should run in a background thread with a "
     "timeout so a downed storage node cannot freeze the main loop."),

    ("gpu_memory_ceiling.txt",
     "A GPU with a 24 GB VRAM ceiling requires a serialization mechanism for model "
     "loads. A Redis lock (vram_mutex) gates concurrent agent spawns so they cannot "
     "collectively exceed the ceiling. Keep the vector store Top-K at 3 or lower to "
     "avoid embedding OOM during heavy inference workloads."),

    ("deliverable_verification.txt",
     "A deliverable verification table links to the work-item (mandate) table. Each "
     "row holds sequence number, title, expected file path, minimum byte size, and "
     "status. An agent calls complete_mandate_task per deliverable; the system "
     "verifies the file exists on disk before setting status to VERIFIED. The "
     "work-item auto-promotes when all deliverable rows reach VERIFIED."),

    ("hallucination_block_threshold.txt",
     "A pipeline stage correction function auto-sets a work item to FAILED when "
     "hallucination_count reaches the block threshold (default 5) or when "
     "skipped_steps reaches the same threshold. The threshold is configurable via "
     "an environment variable. Do not re-run manually after a block — the scheduler "
     "re-dispatches FAILED items on the next cycle."),

    ("access_ring_policy.txt",
     "Context rings gate agent read access in the vector store. Ring 1 is public "
     "(any agent), Ring 2 is confidential client data (restricted agents only), "
     "Ring 3 is financial and legal data, Ring 4 is personal data (home agent only). "
     "An authorized_ring filter is applied before returning any vector store payload "
     "to prevent cross-ring data leakage."),

    ("asyncio_timeout_str_bug.txt",
     "asyncio.TimeoutError.__str__() returns an empty string — using str(exc) in a "
     "log message produces a blank line that hides the root cause. Use "
     "type(exc).__name__ instead to get the exception class name. This silent failure "
     "hid timeout root causes in an error remediator service for several weeks."),

    ("file_lock_vs_asyncio_lock.txt",
     "Use file locks instead of asyncio.Lock for cross-process mutual exclusion. "
     "asyncio semaphores are process-local — subprocess boundaries destroy their "
     "scope. Any gate that must coordinate between a parent process and spawned "
     "subprocesses should use fcntl.flock on Linux."),

    ("model_tier_eviction.txt",
     "Model tier batching order is largest-first: 32b → 8b → API fallback. The "
     "coordinator evicts a model at tier boundaries with keep_alive=0 to release "
     "VRAM before loading the next tier. Streaming mode zombie processes are killed "
     "explicitly before the next model loads. Regression tests guard this ordering."),

    ("boolean_env_var_pitfall.txt",
     "bool(os.environ.get('FLAG')) evaluates the string '0' as True because any "
     "non-empty string is truthy in Python. Use an explicit allowlist instead: "
     "value not in ('', '0', 'false', 'no'). Relying on bool() for flag parsing "
     "causes DRY_RUN and similar flags to behave opposite to the operator's intent."),

    ("spec_deviation_disclosure.txt",
     "Before marking a spec-driven work item complete, an agent must self-diff: "
     "'Spec required X deliverables, I shipped Y. Substitutions: Z. Deferred: N.' "
     "Silent partial compliance is harder to catch than a crash because the output "
     "looks complete. A completion summary that does not address the spec is itself "
     "incomplete — the reviewer cannot catch the deviation without this disclosure."),

    ("cursor_based_extraction.txt",
     "A memory extractor uses a UUID cursor to track the last processed message. On "
     "each periodic invocation it reads only new messages since the cursor, classifies "
     "them with a policy enforcer, and ingests approved content to the correct "
     "collection. The cursor prevents reprocessing and keeps ingestion idempotent."),

    ("proposal_engine_sources.txt",
     "An autonomous proposal engine scans five sources: error telemetry, agent "
     "failure rates, stuck work items, dead code (functions with zero inbound call "
     "edges in the call graph), and schema drift (foreign key columns missing "
     "indexes). Proposals are deduplicated before filing to avoid flooding the "
     "work-item queue with redundant entries."),

    ("package_security_pipeline.txt",
     "Every new Python package must pass three gates before production: (1) a "
     "library fetcher validates SHA256 against the package registry's published "
     "digests, (2) a detonation step runs the wheel in an isolated sandbox with "
     "a network sinkhole to detect runtime exfiltration, (3) a systemic audit "
     "scans the full requirements file for typosquats. A threat score above the "
     "threshold blocks the package."),

    ("work_item_lifecycle.txt",
     "Work item lifecycle states: PENDING → IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW_READY → COMPLETED "
     "or FAILED. PROPOSED means an AI-generated idea awaiting operator promotion — "
     "never auto-dispatched. BLOCKED means an external dependency is unresolved. "
     "CANCELLED means the operator killed it. Promotion to REVIEW_READY is blocked "
     "if any deliverable rows are unverified."),

    ("subprocess_stdout_discipline.txt",
     "A subprocess that produces machine-readable output must write JSON to stdout "
     "and diagnostic logs to stderr. If structured output lands on stderr, the "
     "caller's json.loads() receives an empty string and throws JSONDecodeError. "
     "The fix is explicit sys.stdout.write() for all machine-readable output — "
     "never rely on print()'s default stream."),

    ("partitioned_index_creation.txt",
     "CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY on a partitioned Postgres table must target each "
     "partition individually, not the parent. The parent index is then automatically "
     "derived from the partition indexes. Attempting CONCURRENTLY on the parent "
     "fails with an error. This affects any large table migrated to partitioning "
     "after initial deployment."),

    ("privileged_command_ott.txt",
     "Privileged host commands should route through a one-time token mechanism so "
     "the operator does not need persistent sudo. Key gotchas: use 'metadata' not "
     "'meta' in the token path, num_uses refers to invocation count not seconds, "
     "and the token is single-session — re-request if the shell restarts."),

    ("sandbox_detonation_protocol.txt",
     "All Docker and Python modifications must be validated in an isolated sandbox "
     "environment before applying to the host. The sandbox uses a network sinkhole "
     "so outbound calls are blocked during testing. This protocol applies to 'quick' "
     "changes as well — size of change does not exempt it from sandbox validation."),

    ("memory_capture_policy.txt",
     "Capture to the long-term memory store: architectural decisions and the reason "
     "behind them, failure lessons, non-obvious constraints, operator context, and "
     "work-item outcomes. Do NOT capture: code text (version control has it), raw "
     "telemetry (relational DB only), transient state, live metrics, or content that "
     "duplicates an existing reference document. Classify before ingesting."),

    ("sbom_tracking.txt",
     "After any batch of new Python packages, update the software bill-of-materials "
     "graph to keep it current. The SBOM includes SHA256 hash, registry validation "
     "date, and sandbox detonation threat score for each package. Retroactive "
     "validation is required for any package added without going through the "
     "security pipeline."),

    ("scheduler_ghost_job_handling.txt",
     "The job scheduler checks for PENDING work items every cycle and dispatches to "
     "the correct agent. Ghost jobs — work items stuck IN_PROGRESS with no heartbeat "
     "for more than 30 minutes — are automatically reset to PENDING for re-dispatch. "
     "The morning summary digest fires once at a configured time; per-spawn "
     "notifications are suppressed to prevent notification floods."),

    ("model_eviction_before_load.txt",
     "When switching model tiers, explicitly evict the outgoing model before loading "
     "the incoming one. Do not rely on automatic eviction — it is time-based, not "
     "memory-based, and will not free VRAM fast enough under concurrent load. The "
     "streaming zombie kill must complete before eviction, and eviction must "
     "complete before the next load begins."),
